# About

## Safe?
Yes this is safe, there have been **zero** recorded cases of a Khan account being banned for hacks (they've started fixing the hack but nothing against users.). <br>
Also if you're asking if this is a virus it is 100% open sourced forever so you can look through the code to see for yourself. <br>
